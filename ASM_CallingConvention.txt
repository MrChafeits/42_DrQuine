System V AMD64 ABI:
The first six integer or pointer arguments are passed in registers RDI, RSI, RDX,
RCX, R8, R9 (R10 is used as a static chain pointer in case of nested functions),
while XMM0, XMM1, XMM2, XMM3, XMM4, XMM5, XMM6 and XMM7 are used for the first
floating point arguments. As in the Microsoft x64 calling convention,
additional arguments are passed on the stack. Integer return values up to 64 bits
in size are stored in RAX while values up to 128 bit are stored in RAX and RDX.
Floating-point return values are similarly stored in XMM0 and XMM1. The wider
YMM and ZMM registers are used for passing and returning wider values in place of XMM when they exist
